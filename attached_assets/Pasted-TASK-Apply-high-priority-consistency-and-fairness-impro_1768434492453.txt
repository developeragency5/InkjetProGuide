TASK: Apply high-priority consistency and fairness improvements to the Return / Refund Policy.

────────────────────────
FIX 2: Quick Summary vs Restocking Fee consistency
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
The Quick Summary wording does not precisely match the detailed Restocking Fee structure.

TEXT TO REMOVE (Quick Summary line):
“Full refund on unopened items; opened items showing signs of use may incur up to 15% restocking fee.”

APPROVED REPLACEMENT (USE EXACTLY):

30-Day Return Policy: Return eligible printers within 30 days of delivery. Unopened or opened-but-unused items may qualify for a full refund. Items that show signs of use may incur up to a 15% restocking fee.

RULES:
- Replace the Quick Summary line only.
- Do NOT change the detailed Restocking Fee Structure section.

────────────────────────
FIX 3: Damage reporting window (chargeback-safe)
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
“Contact us within 48 hours” appears overly strict and can trigger disputes.

TEXT TO REPLACE:
“Contact us within 48 hours of delivery…”

APPROVED SAFER VERSION (USE EXACTLY):

Contact us as soon as possible (preferably within 48 hours) of delivery…

RULES:
- Replace wording only.
- Keep the rest of the paragraph unchanged.

────────────────────────
FIX 4: Pickup / replacement overpromise
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
“Immediate pickup” is not always operationally possible.

TEXT TO REMOVE:
“We’ll arrange immediate pickup and send a replacement”

APPROVED SAFER REPLACEMENT (USE EXACTLY):

“We’ll arrange a return shipment or pickup where available and issue a replacement or refund at no cost to you.”

RULES:
- Replace the sentence only.
- Do NOT add guarantees or timelines.

────────────────────────
OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENT 5: Return exceptions clarity (recommended)
────────────────────────

ADD THIS LINE under the “Eligible Returns” section (USE EXACTLY):

Items returned missing accessories, packaging, or with physical damage may be subject to a partial refund or refusal.

RULES:
- Insert as a single standalone sentence.
- Do NOT bold or emphasize.

────────────────────────
OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENT 6: Registration / activation note (ONLY IF ENFORCED)
────────────────────────

IF you actually enforce this rule, ADD this line under return conditions:

Products that have been registered, activated, or tied to a service subscription may be treated as “used” for return purposes.

IF NOT ENFORCED:
- Do NOT add this line.

────────────────────────
ACCEPTANCE CHECK:
- Quick Summary now matches Restocking Fee rules exactly.
- “48 hours” language is softened to “preferably within 48 hours”.
- No “immediate pickup” promises remain.
- Optional lines (5–6) appear only once and only if applicable.
- No other Return Policy sections are modified.

GOAL:
- Reduce chargeback and dispute risk
- Improve internal policy consistency
- Maintain customer-friendly but legally fair returns language
