TASK: Fix sitemap and navigation naming inconsistencies and apply light compliance-safe polish.

SCOPE:
- Sitemap page
- Main navigation
- Footer navigation
- Do NOT modify product pages, checkout, or policies

────────────────────────
FIX 1: “All Products” vs “All Printers” inconsistency (REQUIRED)
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
The sitemap uses “All Products” while navigation and footer use “All Printers”, creating taxonomy confusion and ad-review QA flags.

DECISION (USE THIS):
Standardize on: “All Printers”

ACTION:
- Replace “All Products” with “All Printers” in the sitemap.
- Ensure “All Printers” is used consistently in:
  - Sitemap
  - Header navigation
  - Footer navigation

RULES:
- Replace label text only.
- Do NOT change URLs unless absolutely required.
- Do NOT introduce both terms anywhere.

────────────────────────
MEDIUM-PRIORITY FIX 2: Wishlist visibility (ONLY IF NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL)
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
If Wishlist is not fully functional, listing it without context can be misleading.

CHOOSE ONE OPTION:

OPTION A (REMOVE):
- Remove “Wishlist” from the sitemap and navigation.

OPTION B (KEEP WITH CLARIFIER):
- Update label to:
  “Wishlist (available for registered users)”

RULE:
- Use ONLY one option.
- Apply consistently wherever Wishlist appears.

────────────────────────
MEDIUM-PRIORITY FIX 3: “Model Guide” ambiguity
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
“Model Guide” can be misread as manufacturer-official.

RENAME “Model Guide” to ONE of the following (choose one and use consistently):

- Printer Model Guides
OR
- Printer Comparison Guides
OR
- Inkjet Model Guides

RULE:
- Replace wording only.
- Keep content unchanged.

────────────────────────
OPTIONAL POLISH 4: Student / Home Office guide naming
────────────────────────

OPTIONAL:
If these appear in sitemap or guide lists, rename as follows:

- “Student Guide” → “Student Printing Guide”
- “Home Office Guide” → “Home Office Printing Guide”

RULE:
- Optional but recommended.
- Do NOT change guide content.

────────────────────────
OPTIONAL POLISH 5: Sitemap intro sentence
────────────────────────

TEXT TO REPLACE:
“Browse all pages and sections of InkjetProGuide to find exactly what you're looking for.”

OPTIONAL SAFER VERSION:
“Browse all pages and sections of InkjetProGuide from one place.”

────────────────────────
OPTIONAL POLISH 6: Date consistency
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
“Last Updated: January 2025” conflicts with © 2026 footer.

CHOOSE ONE OPTION:

OPTION A:
Update “Last Updated” to:
January 2026

OPTION B:
Update footer copyright to:
© 2025–2026 InkjetProGuide

RULE:
- Choose one approach.
- Keep dates consistent site-wide.

────────────────────────
FINAL ACCEPTANCE CHECK:
- “All Printers” is the single, consistent term everywhere.
- No non-functional features are implied.
- Guide names are neutral and informational.
- Sitemap tone avoids guarantees.
- Dates are consistent.

GOAL:
Eliminate taxonomy confusion, reduce ad-review QA flags, and keep sitemap/navigation clean, neutral, and reseller-safe.
