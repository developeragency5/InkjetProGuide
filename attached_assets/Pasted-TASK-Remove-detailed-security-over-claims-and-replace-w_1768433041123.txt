TASK: Remove detailed security over-claims and replace with a safe, accurate security statement.

CRITICAL ISSUE:
Detailed claims such as AES-256 encryption at rest, bcrypt hashing, role-based access controls, or account lockout policies may be inaccurate or unverifiable in hosted or third-party platforms. False security statements create legal and compliance risk.

SCOPE:
- Apply ONLY to the Privacy Policy (Security / Data Protection sections).
- Identify and REMOVE entire subsections or bullet points related to:
  - Encryption at rest (AES-256)
  - Password hashing methods (bcrypt or similar)
  - Account lockout policies
  - Role-based access controls
  - Encrypted database connections
- Do NOT change unrelated privacy sections.

APPROVED SAFE REPLACEMENT TEXT
(MUST MATCH EXACTLY — COPY/PASTE, NO EDITS):

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information. This includes HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for data transmission and access controls to limit who can access personal information.
Payment information is processed by our payment processor (Stripe) and we do not store full payment card numbers on our servers.

PLACEMENT RULES:
- Insert this text where the removed security subsections previously appeared.
- Keep paragraph formatting (two sentences, two lines).
- Do NOT add headings unless one already exists (e.g., “Security”).

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT mention specific encryption standards (AES-256, bcrypt, etc.).
- Do NOT claim certifications, audits, or compliance (PCI, SOC 2, ISO).
- Do NOT add guarantees such as “100% secure” or “fully protected”.
- Do NOT expand beyond the approved text.

ACCEPTANCE CHECK:
- No detailed or technical security implementation claims remain.
- The replacement text appears exactly as written.
- Security language now reflects reasonable safeguards, not guarantees.

GOAL:
- Eliminate false or unverifiable security claims
- Align with hosted-platform realities
- Maintain trust while remaining legally accurate
