TASK: Apply minor compliance wording refinements to the “Contact Us” page ONLY.

PAGE SCOPE:
- Contact Us page content
- FAQs shown on the Contact page
- Phone support section text
- Do NOT change layout, navigation, footer, or other pages

────────────────────────
REQUIRED FIX 1: Soften shipping speed language (IMPORTANT)
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
“Standard delivery takes 2–3 business days” reads like a guarantee.

TEXT TO REMOVE:
“Standard delivery takes 2–3 business days…”

APPROVED SAFE REPLACEMENT
(USE EXACTLY):

“Standard delivery typically takes 2–3 business days after shipment. Delivery times may vary based on location, carrier conditions, and order processing.”

RULES:
- Replace wording only
- Do NOT add guarantees or promises

────────────────────────
REQUIRED FIX 2: Phone support clarification (VERY LOW RISK, BUT IMPORTANT)
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
Users may assume phone support includes technical troubleshooting.

ADD THIS LINE directly BELOW:
“Phone Support (Order Assistance Only)”

TEXT TO ADD (USE EXACTLY):

“We do not provide manufacturer technical support or product troubleshooting by phone.”

STYLE:
- Plain text
- Same font size as surrounding copy
- No icons or emphasis

────────────────────────
OPTIONAL HARDENING A: Manufacturer independence reminder
────────────────────────

ADD this sentence ONCE under the “Order Inquiries Only” section:

“InkjetProGuide does not provide manufacturer-authorized technical support or warranty service.”

RULES:
- Optional but recommended
- Plain text only

────────────────────────
OPTIONAL HARDENING B: Response-time softening
────────────────────────

TEXT TO REPLACE (OPTIONAL):
“Response within 24 business hours”

SAFER VERSION (USE IF APPLIED):

“We aim to respond within 24 business hours.”

────────────────────────
DO NOT CHANGE (IMPORTANT):
- Administrative / mailing address explanation
- Third-party fulfillment disclosure
- Payment method restrictions
- Order-only support scope
- Business hours display
- No manufacturer affiliation language

────────────────────────
FINAL ACCEPTANCE CHECK:
- Shipping timelines are clearly non-guaranteed
- Phone support scope is unambiguous
- No technical or warranty support is implied
- Page remains LOW-RISK for Google Ads review

GOAL:
Make the Contact page near-bulletproof for ads approval, consumer-protection review, and brand-policy enforcement while preserving existing trust signals.
