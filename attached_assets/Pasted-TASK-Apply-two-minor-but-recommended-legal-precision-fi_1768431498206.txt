TASK: Apply two minor but recommended legal-precision fixes.

────────────────────────
MINOR ISSUE #1: Liability wording (legal standard alignment)
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
The phrase “Under no circumstance” creates absolute liability exclusion risk in some jurisdictions.

TEXT TO REMOVE:
“Under no circumstance shall InkjetProGuide have any liability to you for any loss or damage…”

APPROVED SAFE REPLACEMENT
(MUST MATCH EXACTLY — COPY/PASTE, NO EDITS):

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, InkjetProGuide shall not be liable to you for any loss or damage…

SCOPE:
- Apply ONLY where the removed sentence appears (Terms, Disclaimer, or similar legal sections).
- Replace wording only; do NOT change surrounding clauses or formatting.

RULES:
- Do NOT add new liability exclusions.
- Do NOT remove jurisdiction or governing-law language.
- Keep punctuation and paragraph structure consistent.

GOAL:
- Align with modern legal drafting standards
- Avoid unenforceable absolute exclusions
- Maintain internal document consistency

────────────────────────
MINOR ISSUE #2: Product availability clarification
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
“Product availability is not guaranteed and may vary” is correct but should clarify order-time acceptance.

ADD THIS LINE DIRECTLY UNDER THE EXISTING PRODUCT INFORMATION DISCLAIMER
(MUST MATCH EXACTLY):

Orders are subject to acceptance and product availability at the time of purchase confirmation.

SCOPE:
- Apply to Product Information Disclaimer sections
- Do NOT add to checkout flow or product titles

RULES:
- Insert as a single standalone sentence.
- Do NOT bold, italicize, or emphasize.
- Do NOT add conditions or examples.

────────────────────────
ACCEPTANCE CHECK:
- “Under no circumstance” wording no longer exists.
- Replacement liability sentence appears exactly as written.
- Product availability section includes the new order-time clarification.
- No other content is modified.

GOAL:
- Cleaner legal enforceability
- Reduced dispute ambiguity
- Professional, ads-safe documentation
