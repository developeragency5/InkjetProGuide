TASK: Apply critical brand-safety and ad-compliance fixes to homepage, category pages, and related sections.

────────────────────────
FIX 1: Product names using brand-identifiable model numbers (CRITICAL)
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
Model numbers like DeskJet 4255e, Envy 7955e, OfficeJet 8015e, Smart Tank 7602 uniquely identify HP products and create brand-targeting risk.

REQUIRED ACTION (SAFEST OPTION — USE THIS):
- REMOVE model numbers from:
  - Homepage product grids
  - Category page product grids
- Replace with generic, descriptive product names ONLY.

EXAMPLES:
❌ “DeskJet 4255e Wireless All-in-One”
✅ “Wireless All-in-One Inkjet Printer for Home Use”

❌ “OfficeJet 8015e”
✅ “High-Volume Inkjet Printer for Small Offices”

DO NOT:
- Show model numbers on homepage or category pages
- Use manufacturer-specific series names

NOTE:
(Model numbers may remain on individual product detail pages if already compliant elsewhere.)

────────────────────────
FIX 2: Processing time claim (CRITICAL)
────────────────────────

TEXT TO REMOVE:
“Most orders ship within 24 hours”

APPROVED REPLACEMENT (USE EXACTLY):

Orders are typically processed within 1–2 business days, subject to availability and verification.

────────────────────────
FIX 3: Delivery time claim (CRITICAL)
────────────────────────

TEXT TO REMOVE:
“delivery in 2–3 business days”

APPROVED REPLACEMENT (USE EXACTLY):

Estimated delivery times typically range from 2–5 business days depending on carrier and destination.

────────────────────────
FIX 4: Manufacturer-sounding collection names
────────────────────────

TEXT TO REMOVE:
“Professional Office Series”

APPROVED SAFE REPLACEMENTS (choose ONE):

Office Inkjet Collection
OR
Inkjet Printers for Office Use

────────────────────────
FIX 5: “Curated selection” wording (minor but recommended)
────────────────────────

TEXT TO REMOVE:
“curated selection”

OPTIONAL SAFER REPLACEMENT:

independently sourced selection

────────────────────────
FIX 6: Comparison / superiority language
────────────────────────

TEXT TO REMOVE:
“why inkjet often beats laser printers”

APPROVED FACT-BASED REPLACEMENT:

situations where inkjet printers may be more suitable than laser printers

────────────────────────
FIX 7: Customer reviews presentation (MODERATE RISK)
────────────────────────

ADD THIS LINE directly ABOVE the reviews section (USE EXACTLY):

Reviews reflect individual customer experiences and are not guarantees of performance. Reviews may be collected manually or through internal verification processes.

AND SIMPLIFY REVIEW LABELS:
REPLACE:
“Verified Buyer • Order IPG-2025-4521”

WITH:
“Verified Purchase”

DO NOT:
- Show order numbers
- Imply third-party verification unless actually used

────────────────────────
FIX 8: Newsletter quantitative claim
────────────────────────

TEXT TO REMOVE:
“Join thousands of inkjet printer owners”

APPROVED SAFE REPLACEMENT:

Join our newsletter for printer deals, updates, and buying guides.

────────────────────────
FIX 9: Trademark disclaimer placement (CRITICAL)
────────────────────────

ADD THIS DISCLAIMER ONCE near the TOP of the page
(Directly BELOW the hero section — USE EXACTLY):
