TASK: Patch the Privacy Policy to remove consent/over-claim risks and align wording with an independent US e-commerce store + guides running search ads.

SCOPE:
- Apply ONLY to the Privacy Policy page.
- Make wording edits only; do NOT change site functionality.
- Do NOT add technical claims (pixels/GPC detection) unless the policy already states them and they are truly implemented.

────────────────────────
HIGH-RISK FIX 1: Remove “agree to this Privacy Policy” contract-style language
────────────────────────

FIND the sentence(s) like:
“By using the Site… you acknowledge… and agree to its terms… If you do not agree, discontinue…”

REPLACE that language with (USE EXACTLY):

By using the Site, you acknowledge you have read this Privacy Policy.

RULES:
- Do NOT use “agree”, “consent”, or “accept” for the Privacy Policy as a whole.
- Keep consent language ONLY where consent is actually collected (e.g., cookies/marketing emails).

────────────────────────
HIGH-RISK FIX 2: Marketing platforms / personalized ads — add safe identifier clarification + opt-out scope
────────────────────────

UNDER the section discussing “Marketing Platforms”, “Advertising”, “Personalized ads”, or similar,
ADD this sentence (USE EXACTLY):

We may share online identifiers (such as cookie IDs, device identifiers, and IP address) with advertising partners for measurement and ad delivery, subject to your cookie choices and applicable law.

UNDER the opt-out / Do Not Sell or Share / CPRA “sharing” explanation,
ADD this sentence (USE EXACTLY):

Opt-out applies to cross-context behavioral advertising; it does not stop contextual ads.

RULES:
- Do NOT mention specific pixels (Meta, etc.) unless you actually use them.
- Keep wording as “may” unless you are certain it is used.

────────────────────────
HIGH-RISK FIX 3: Sensitive personal information — remove incorrect billing-address framing
────────────────────────

FIND the “Sensitive personal information” paragraph that says or implies:
“We collect limited sensitive personal information (primarily precise billing addresses…)”

REPLACE that entire paragraph with (USE EXACTLY):

We do not use sensitive personal information for purposes other than providing our services, security, fraud prevention, and compliance with law.

RULES:
- Do NOT classify billing address as “sensitive personal information.”
- Do NOT list CPRA SPI categories unless you are sure.

────────────────────────
HIGH-RISK FIX 4: Payment processor naming consistency (choose ONE approach)
────────────────────────

Choose ONE option below and apply consistently across the Privacy Policy:

OPTION A (Name Stripe everywhere):
- Wherever the policy says “payment processor” or “payment provider”, update to “our payment processor, Stripe”.

OPTION B (Do not name any processor):
- Replace any mention of “Stripe” with “our payment processor”.

IMPORTANT:
- Use only ONE option site-wide within the Privacy Policy.

Also ensure the Payment Information sentence remains (or is updated to match this approach):
We collect only the information necessary to process payments and fulfill orders. Payment details are handled by our payment processor, and we do not store full card numbers on our servers.

────────────────────────
MEDIUM-RISK FIX 5: Remove or soften over-disclosure lists that may be untrue
────────────────────────

REVIEW lists mentioning items you may not actually use, such as:
- DHL
- U.S. territories claims
- affiliate/partner referrals
- co-branded promotions
- device fingerprints
- scroll depth
- broad “marketing partner demographics”

RULE:
- Convert absolute statements to “may” ONLY if truly possible, or remove items that are not used.
- If listing carriers, use safe wording:
“USPS, UPS, FedEx (or other carriers you select at checkout).”

Do NOT claim “device fingerprinting” unless actually used.

────────────────────────
MEDIUM-RISK FIX 6: Suppression list deletion promise (CAN-SPAM safe)
────────────────────────

FIND language like:
“remove from both active and suppression lists”

REPLACE with (USE EXACTLY):

We may retain a record of your opt-out to ensure we honor your request.

────────────────────────
MEDIUM-RISK FIX 7: GPC wording — only if not technically guaranteed
────────────────────────

If the policy currently states an absolute claim like:
“We honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals…”

REPLACE that sentence with (USE EXACTLY):

Where supported, we will process Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals and treat GPC as a valid request to opt out of “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising for California residents.

RULE:
- Use this “Where supported” version unless you are 100% sure GPC is implemented.

────────────────────────
MEDIUM-RISK FIX 8: Timing language for opt-out processing
────────────────────────

If the policy states a fixed SLA like:
“Respond within 15 business days” for opt-out / sale-share requests,

REPLACE with (USE EXACTLY):

We will process requests as soon as reasonably possible, and within the time required by applicable law.

────────────────────────
LOW-RISK POLISH (OPTIONAL): Add Notice at Collection summary at the top
────────────────────────

Add a short section near the beginning titled:
Notice at Collection (Summary)

Include only high-level bullets:
- Categories collected
- Purposes
- Whether you sell/share (and link to “Do Not Sell or Share” if present)

RULE:
- Keep it brief and consistent with the rest of the policy.

────────────────────────
ACCEPTANCE CHECK:
- No “agree to this Privacy Policy” language remains.
- Sensitive PI section is no longer incorrect.
- Suppression list promise is compliant.
- Marketing/ad identifier sharing is described safely with opt-out scope.
- Payment processor naming is consistent (either always Stripe or never Stripe).
- No false tech claims remain (GPC, fingerprinting, etc.).

GOAL:
Make the Privacy Policy audit-safe for Google Ads/manual review, CPRA/consumer expectations, and payment processor scrutiny—without over-claiming features you may not control.
