TASK: Apply three IMPORTANT legal-safety fixes to the Terms & Conditions.

────────────────────────
FIX 1: “AS IS” wording (consumer-law safe)
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
“All products sold ‘AS IS’” can conflict with consumer protection laws in some U.S. states.

TEXT TO REMOVE:
“All products sold through InkjetProGuide are sold ‘AS IS’…”

APPROVED SAFER REPLACEMENT
(MUST MATCH EXACTLY — COPY/PASTE, NO EDITS):

“All products are sold with any applicable manufacturer warranty. InkjetProGuide does not provide additional warranties beyond those offered by the manufacturer, except as required by applicable law.”

SCOPE:
- Replace only the sentence containing “AS IS”.
- Do NOT remove manufacturer-warranty references elsewhere.

────────────────────────
FIX 2: Risk of Loss clause (carrier liability)
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
Absolute “risk of loss passes to you upon delivery to the carrier” language can cause disputes in buyer-friendly states.

TEXT TO REMOVE:
“Risk of loss passes to you upon delivery to the carrier”

APPROVED SAFER REPLACEMENT
(MUST MATCH EXACTLY):

“Risk of loss passes to you upon delivery of the product to the shipping carrier, except where otherwise required by applicable consumer protection laws.”

SCOPE:
- Replace the sentence only.
- Keep the rest of the shipping or risk section unchanged.

────────────────────────
FIX 3: Arbitration opt-out (recommended for enforceability)
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
Adding an opt-out improves arbitration enforceability and reduces legal challenge risk.

ADD THIS SECTION directly AFTER the “Binding Arbitration” header
(MUST MATCH EXACTLY — COPY/PASTE, NO EDITS):

Arbitration Opt-Out
You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending written notice to inkjetproguide@outlook.com within thirty (30) days of first using the Site or placing your first order. Your notice must include your name, email address, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration.

STYLE RULES:
- Use normal body text.
- Do NOT bold or highlight.
- Keep heading levels consistent.

────────────────────────
ACCEPTANCE CHECK:
- No “AS IS” product-sale wording remains.
- Risk of loss language now includes consumer-law protection.
- Arbitration Opt-Out section appears once, immediately after the Binding Arbitration header.
- No other Terms sections are modified.

GOAL:
- Stronger consumer-law compatibility
- Reduced dispute and chargeback risk
- Improved arbitration enforceability
