TASK: Apply targeted compliance wording fixes to the “About InkjetProGuide” page ONLY.

PAGE SCOPE:
- About InkjetProGuide page content
- Do NOT modify navigation, layout, footer, or other pages
- Do NOT remove existing independence disclaimers or structure

────────────────────────
REQUIRED FIX 1: Remove “exclusive features” wording
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
The phrase “exclusive features” can imply manufacturer partnership or reseller privilege.

TEXT TO REMOVE:
“We offer the latest models, exclusive features, and cutting-edge printing technology…”

APPROVED SAFE REPLACEMENT
(USE EXACTLY):

“We offer the latest models and highlight advanced features and modern printing technologies available across current printer lineups.”

RULES:
- Replace the sentence only
- Do NOT add exclusivity or partnership language

────────────────────────
REQUIRED FIX 2: Manufacturer warranty clarification
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
Warranty wording should avoid implying seller-provided warranty service.

TEXT TO REMOVE:
“Products are covered by the manufacturer's quality standards and warranty terms.”

APPROVED SAFER VERSION
(USE EXACTLY):

“Products may be covered by the manufacturer’s warranty according to the manufacturer’s terms and conditions. InkjetProGuide does not provide manufacturer warranty service.”

RULES:
- Replace sentence only
- Do NOT add brand names
- Do NOT promise warranty handling

────────────────────────
OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED FIX 3: Payment language clarity
────────────────────────

TEXT TO REPLACE:
“We accept secure electronic payment methods shown at checkout.”

APPROVED SAFER VERSION
(USE EXACTLY):

“We accept secure electronic payment methods as displayed at checkout. Payment availability may vary by order and location.”

RULES:
- Replace wording only
- Do NOT add processor names

────────────────────────
OPTIONAL HARDENING A: Editorial independence disclaimer
────────────────────────

ADD this sentence ONCE, directly under the first paragraph of the page:

All buying guides are provided for informational purposes only and are not sponsored, endorsed, or reviewed by any printer manufacturer.

STYLE:
- Plain text
- No bold, no icons

────────────────────────
OPTIONAL HARDENING B: Shipping claim softening
────────────────────────

TEXT TO REMOVE:
“Fast 2–3 business day delivery across the United States.”

APPROVED SAFER VERSION
(USE EXACTLY):

“Most orders ship within 2–3 business days. Delivery timelines may vary by location and carrier.”

RULES:
- Replace wording only
- Do NOT add guarantees

────────────────────────
DO NOT CHANGE (IMPORTANT):
- Independent retailer disclaimers
- “Not affiliated / not endorsed / not sponsored” language
- Separation between guides and store
- Payment transparency sections
- Returns and shipping structure
- No logos, no manufacturer branding

────────────────────────
FINAL ACCEPTANCE CHECK:
- No exclusivity or partnership implication remains
- Warranty responsibility is clearly assigned to manufacturer
- Payment and shipping language is non-guaranteed
- Editorial independence is clearly stated
- Page remains LOW-RISK for Google Ads and brand review

GOAL:
Maintain a near-bulletproof About page for ads approval, trademark safety, and consumer-protection audits.
