TASK: Remove all Cash on Delivery (COD) refund language and align the Return Policy with Stripe-only payments.

CRITICAL ISSUE:
The Return Policy still references refunds for Cash on Delivery (COD), which contradicts:
- Terms & Conditions
- Payment Policy
- Privacy Policy
- Checkout flow (Stripe-only)

This creates policy inconsistency, ad-review risk, and customer dispute risk.

CONTENT TO REMOVE COMPLETELY:
Delete any sentence or subsection that mentions:
- “Cash on Delivery”
- “COD refunds”
- “refund via check”
- “refund via bank transfer”
- Any offline or non-electronic refund method

APPROVED REPLACEMENT SECTION
(MUST MATCH EXACTLY — COPY/PASTE, NO EDITS):

Refund Method

Credit/Debit Cards (Stripe): Refunded to the original payment method. We process refunds within 5–7 business days after inspection. Your bank may take an additional 3–5 business days to post the credit.

If a payment fails or a card is closed/expired: We may request an alternative refund method (such as store credit or a replacement card) to complete the refund securely.

SCOPE:
- Apply ONLY to the Return Policy / Refund Policy page.
- Replace the entire existing “Refund Method” section.
- Do NOT change return eligibility, timelines, or inspection language elsewhere.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT mention Cash on Delivery anywhere in the Return Policy.
- Do NOT add checks, wire transfers, ACH, or cash refunds.
- Do NOT guarantee refund timing beyond what is written above.
- Do NOT name any payment processor other than “Stripe” as shown.

FORMAT RULES:
- Keep the heading “Refund Method”.
- Use two short paragraphs exactly as shown.
- No bullets, icons, bolding, or callouts.

ACCEPTANCE CHECK:
- “Cash on Delivery” no longer exists anywhere in the Return Policy.
- Refund language matches Terms, Payment Policy, Privacy Policy, and Checkout.
- Refund expectations are clear, conditional, and processor-safe.

GOAL:
- Eliminate COD contradictions completely
- Reduce ad-review and payment-processor risk
- Prevent refund-method disputes
- Lock Stripe-only consistency site-wide
